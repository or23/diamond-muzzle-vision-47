/*
  # Fix search path security issue and improve RLS policies
  
  1. Changes
    - Set fixed search path for get_user_statistics function
    - Add explicit schema references
    - Improve RLS policies for inventory and diamonds tables
    - Fix type mismatch between bigint and uuid in policies
  
  2. Security
    - Removes mutable search path vulnerability
    - Ensures users can only access their own data
    - Prevents potential privilege escalation
