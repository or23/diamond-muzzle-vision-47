  # Fix Inventory Table Layout and Add Delete API
  
  1. New Functions
    - `delete_diamond` function to safely delete diamonds by stock number
  
  2. Changes
    - Modify inventory table to ensure stock_number is properly displayed
    - Add index on stock_number for faster lookups
  
  3. Security
    - Ensure RLS policies are properly applied
    - Function uses security definer to maintain permissions
