/*
  # Security Improvements for Database Functions and Policies
  
  1. Changes
    - Fix get_user_statistics function with proper search path
    - Update inventory access policy for better security
    - Add proper RLS policies for diamonds table
    - Use correct pg_catalog queries for policy management
  
  2. Security
    - Prevent search path manipulation
    - Ensure users can only access their own data
    - Add proper authentication checks
