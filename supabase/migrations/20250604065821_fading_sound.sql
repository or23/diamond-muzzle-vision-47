  # Security Improvements for Database Functions and Policies
  
  1. New Security Features
    - Fixed search path for get_user_statistics function
    - Improved inventory access policy with proper type handling
    - Enhanced diamonds table policies with proper authentication checks
  
  2. Changes
    - Dropped and recreated get_user_statistics with secure search path
    - Updated inventory policy to use proper type comparisons
    - Added comprehensive RLS policies for diamonds table
  
  3. Security
    - Prevents search path manipulation attacks
    - Ensures users can only access their own data
    - Implements proper row-level security for all operations
